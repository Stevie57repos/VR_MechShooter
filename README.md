## VR Game Description
This VR Mech Shooter Prototype was made over the winter break off work. The project was inspired from a scene in the Matrix 3 where the humans use mechs with guns to fight and defend their undeground city from waves of enemy sentinels. My goal was to recreate that experience and feeling in VR.
